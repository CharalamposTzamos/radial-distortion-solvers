# Evaluation of Radial Distortion Solver in GC-RANSAC

This repo contains GC-RANSAC code for paper "Are Minimal Radial Distortion Solvers Necessary for Relative Pose Estimation?" (arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05984, doi: TBA)

Visit our [main Github repo](https://github.com/kocurvik/rd) for our implementation in [PoseLib](https://github.com/PoseLib/PoseLib/tree/dev) and details about the datasets.

Subset of the solvers are based on the efficient implementation in https://github.com/hamburgerlady/fast-radial-solvers.

## Installation

Download the [official GC-RANSAC repo](https://github.com/danini/graph-cut-ransac)

Include our code to the GC-RANSAC directory

Run the solvers!
